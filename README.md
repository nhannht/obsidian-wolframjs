### This is the client for [Woflramjs](https://github.com/JerryI/wolframjs-frontend)

- WolframJs is the open source technology that work almost perectly when you want to work with Wolfram Technology using Web Technology.
- This is merely a client for Obsidian, most of important problems was solved by Wolframjs team.
- The api to embed this technology to other web aplication still being limited, all I can do at this point of time is port a web view for the application
